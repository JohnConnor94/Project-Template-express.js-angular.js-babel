## Structure
```
 .

 ├ client                   # frontend directory
 │   ├ core                 # contains the module js files to configure the angular app
 │   ├ controllers          # all angular.js controllers

## How it works
The template prepare a simple express web server that retrieves an index.html files with angular.js enabled with routing.\
The configuration is intentionally **basic** and **minimal**.

The template's goal is give you a basic configuration to start working asap and to customize this template to your needs.

In /client/index.html there are section for each kind of files (controller, directives...). 

Each subdirectory in client have a template.'type'.js file.\
It contains the very basic structure of that kind of file and components of angular.

There is a README.template.md file that contains the structure of a **_well organized_** readme. 

In package.json there is a field named optionalDependencies with a set of useful libraries that you would add to your project. Feel free to add'em to you dependencies if you want'em.
